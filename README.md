📐 Pythagorean Triplet Checker — Because I Refused to Google the Same Thing 47 Times 😭

This project was born during a math teaching session with my cousin.
We would solve a Pythagorean triplet problem… feel confident… and then immediately open Google just to double-check if it was correct. Over. And over. And over again.

At some point I thought — there has to be a smarter way than manually searching every answer.
So I did what any curious beginner programmer would do… I wrote a Python script to do the checking for us.

Is it a huge complex system? Nope.
Is it a tiny script that saved us from endless searching? Absolutely 😌

Built from scratch while learning Python, experimenting with logic, and trying to make life slightly less annoying.

⚙️ What this tiny brain does

Accepts three numbers

Figures out which one is the biggest

Checks if they form a Pythagorean triplet

Saves your sanity from repetitive searches

🎯 Why this exists

Because repetitive Googling is not a personality trait

Because learning code by solving real problems is more fun

Because even small scripts can feel like big wins when they actually help
