# Pythagorean-triplet-a-b-c-type-logic-
A tiny Python project born out of pure frustration 😭 while teaching my cousin Pythagorean triplets and constantly double-checking answers on Google. So I built a simple script to instantly verify if three numbers make a valid triplet. Super basic, beginner-made, but a fun example of turning a real-life annoyance into code. 🚀
